This is a browser game about destroying ships, it is based on a common game, where opponents place ships on the map and then they try to shoot each other - they guess where they situated the ships. In this game you are trying to destroy ships to save Capitan Jones. Ships are being generated on the map using special algorithm. You have 30 shots - use them wisely! The winners are being saved in a ranking in a database, then you can see who had the best result (managed to destroy all the ships with less shots)

The game had been available at zniszcz-statki.cba.pl and cba was a free hosting these days, now they wanted me to pay for this webpage. Once I have time I will put it on another webpage - now due to studies I don't have much time to put it back somewhere and make it work again. But I will take care of it as soon as possible!
